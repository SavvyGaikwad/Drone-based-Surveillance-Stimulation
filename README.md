A Python-based 3D simulation of an intelligent drone swarm that performs area surveillance using spiral search patterns. Drones dynamically respond to points of interest, terrain topology, and battery constraints with coordinated behaviors like leader election, formation control, and recharging logistics.

Autonomous Patrolling & POI Detection

  16 drones coordinate in a spiral pattern to cover the entire search area.

  On detecting a Point of Interest (POI) (‚≠ê marked on the dashboard), drones:

  Switch from patrolling to engagement mode

  Form a circular formation around the POI

  Dynamically select a leader drone (based on highest battery and lowest distance)

  Leader can be reassigned in real-time if another drone becomes more optimal.

Battery-Aware Logic

  Each drone monitors its battery levels.

  When low, the drone autonomously: Flies back to the nearest base station, Charges, then returns to its original formation slot.

Terrain & Topology
  
  Randomly generated hilly plateau terrain for realistic mission simulation.

  Base station placement adapts to the topology.

Dashboard & Visualization

  Adjustable 3D view for user convenience.

  Intuitive dashboard displays: Drone positions   Battery levels  POIs  Current status (Patrolling / Engaging / Charging)

Clean initialization phase sets up drone parameters, terrain, and simulation environment.

Includes an alternate 3D topological view for terrain-aware drone tracking.

Database

Save each drones number, timestamp, coordinates, status and distance from POI.
